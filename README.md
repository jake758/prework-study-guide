# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for creating this was to be have an interactive study guide to study the material learned during prework. I built this project as a way to test myself with the knowledge I have recently aquired during prework. This application solves the issue of prework students not knowing what to study. I learned a lot making this, most importantly how to use theoretical concepts in practice.
